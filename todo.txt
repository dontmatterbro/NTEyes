URGENT FIXES
FIXED--there seems to be an issue with players getting eye damage on save load
happens after long load times, somehow character gets the affliction without spawning in, I've seen a similar thing discussed in NT discord

FIXED, idk why, but it works now. --cyber eyes can't be repaired with surgery, negative values when using HF.AddAfflictionLimb may be broken, try changing the function
might need to write own functions to fix this, this would also mean that you need to change all the function present in the code, fuck
maybe use a LLM if it comes to that, I don't wanna change 500 functions by hand
maybe change fpga circuit fix to a set amount, instead of relying on condition
