hide afflictions when they don't have to be shown, i.e.
eyes removed and dead eyes should only be shown if there is retracted eyelids affliction, do it as NT does,
keep the affliction value at 1 when there isn't retracted eyes, it there are increase affliction value. 
humanUpdate can solve this easily, some XML configuration is required
