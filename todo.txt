DONE -- remove one side of the screen getting blinded and instead opt for periphereal vision reduction like wearing a suit
DONE [NEEDS TESTING] --multipurpose scalpel comp
DONE -- prevent people installing more than 2 eyes at the same time, put a check for if no removed eye, can't install more eyes.
DONE -- dead eye rework (ouchie) 
DONE --autoimmune retinopathy when one of eyes die, to prevent it the dead eye needs to be removed
DONE -- fix human update and add into NT update loop instead of running your own 
DONE -- apply the effects of both eyes and a penalty if different types of eyes installed at the same time
DONE? --enhance bionic eye mechanics
DONE? (laser surgery still absent) --redo surgeries rn they suck, you shouldn't really need 3 items to perform a surgery, or idk we'll see
DONE -- replace infrared and night vision eyes with bio-mechanical eyes that can be upgraded like a weaker version of bionic eyes.
DONE -- client side eye effect optimizations
CANCELLED -- no need for mechanics that cause bloat --lens damage for eyes / may not implement this, we'll see
probably done idk  -- --fix shit 
CANCELLED -- // decided just to give the multiscalpel eye mechanics, laser surgery stays as it is // --enhance laser surger (maybe a multipurpose scalpel like usage)
CANCELLED -- // decided to remove zoom functions from the mod, I right now can't implement those in a
non invasive way, maybe I'll look into it in the future. // --better enhanced immersion comp
CANCELLED -- // do not know or care if this is possible, seems like bloat // cosmetic green light effect for NVG eyes (I have no fucking clue what I meant when writing this)
DONE --prevent dead bionic and plastic eyes from causing retinopathy
DONE --better eye damage

--eye damage causes NT symptoms, headache, confusion etc. 

--some way to prevent the symptoms of mismatch

--animations for eye damage (bionic eyes getting digital parasites, night vision malfunction etc.
screen going black/red momentarily upon taking damage with regular eyes, blood lines over screen as eye damage increases)

--redo hypotension effect, preferably slightly animate it -- use overlays/corners, like that mod they mentioned on discord (find its name idr)

--animation for walking blind (right now this uses drunk animation, I will try to make a custom one,
but if it turns out to be bother [i.e. have to overwrite human.xml] then I will keep using the drunk one, it ain't bad
but it ain't special either.)

--correct item crafts and usage balance

--enhance the texture for the eye jar (type of eye that shows outside when you put it inside)

--make eye jar placeable AND holdable -- lukako on nt discord worked for a baseline code of this, check that out
--fix eye jars //broken rn

--comp patches for immersive diving and robotrauma (this may not be needed, further inquiry required)

--reduce cataract blur, add gray filter to screen -- use affliction overlays the game comes with, not a whole ass texture

--Cataracts needs to interact more with the rest of the mod
Why is nt concussion interesting and accepted despite being completely harmless? It causes a lot of symptoms that can be mistaken for other dangerous Afflictions
(ThousandFields)

--decide what different types of creature eyes have what effects // 
watcher: psychosis for nearby people
husk: heals really fast, pressure resistant
crawler: better vision outside the sub, worst vision inside

--add eye surgery toolbag

--redo trello

--redo affliction icons

--fix item hold positions, 
--fix SFX (not high priority, but effects overall quality of the mod significantly)

--add eye cream (edible) -> you can craft this using eyes, gives you some buffs idk make it funny

--add eyejar storage icon
