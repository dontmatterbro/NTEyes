DONE -- remove one side of the screen getting blinded and instead opt for periphereal vision reduction like wearing a suit
DONE [NEEDS TESTING] --multipurpose scalpel comp
DONE -- prevent people installing more than 2 eyes at the same time, put a check for if no removed eye, can't install more eyes.
DONE -- dead eye rework (ouchie) 
DONE --autoimmune retinopathy when one of eyes die, to prevent it the dead eye needs to be removed
DONE -- fix human update and add into NT update loop instead of running your own 
DONE -- apply the effects of both eyes and a penalty if different types of eyes installed at the same time
DONE? --enhance bionic eye mechanics
DONE? (laser surgery still absent) --redo surgeries rn they suck, you shouldn't really need 3 items to perform a surgery, or idk we'll see
DONE -- replace infrared and night vision eyes with bio-mechanical eyes that can be upgraded like a weaker version of bionic eyes.
DONE -- client side eye effect optimizations
CANCELLED -- no need for mechanics that cause bloat --lens damage for eyes / may not implement this, we'll see
probably done idk  -- --fix shit 


--better eye damage
(damage resistance calculations for eyes, take a look at NT code and make the calculations like that)
Btw @Walter Hartwell White  can easily adapt my code from fall damage for this case
Specifically the concussion resistance function

--animations for eye damage (bionic eyes getting digital parasites, night vision malfunction etc.
screen going black/red momentarily upon taking damage with regular eyes, blood lines over screen as eye damage increases)

--enhance laser surger (maybe a multipurpose scalpel like usage)

--redo hypotension effect, preferably slightly animate it -- use overlays/corners, like that mod they mentioned on discord (find its name idr)

--better enhanced immersion comp

--cosmetic green light effect for NVG eyes (I have no fucking clue what I meant when writing this)

--animation for walking blind (right now this uses drunk animation, I will try to make a custom one,
but if it turns out to be bother [i.e. have to overwrite human.xml] then I will keep using the drunk one, it ain't bad
but it ain't special either.)

--correct lens crafts and usage balance

--enhance the texture for the eye jar (type of eye that shows outside when you put it inside)

--make eye jar placeable AND holdable -- lukako on nt discord worked for a baseline code of this, check that out

--comp patches for immersive diving and robotrauma (this may not be needed, further inquiry required)

--reduce cataract blur, add gray filter to screen -- use affliction overlays the game comes with, not a whole ass texture

--Cataracts needs to interact more with the rest of the mod
Why is nt concussion interesting and accepted despite being completely harmless? It causes a lot of symptoms that can be mistaken for other dangerous Afflictions
(ThousandFields)

--decide what different types of creature eyes have what effects

--add eye surgery toolbag

--redo trello

--redo affliction icons

--fix item hold positions, 
--fix SFX (not high priority, but effects overall quality of the mod significantly)

--add eye cream (edible) -> you can craft this using eyes, gives you some buffs idk make it funny
