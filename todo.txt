--add eye surgery toolbag and kit
--multipurpose scalpel comp

--dead eye rework (ouchie)

--animations for eye damage (bionic eyes getting digital parasites, night vision malfunction etc.
screen going black/red momentarily upon taking damage with regular eyes, blood lines over screen as eye damage increases)

--enhance laser surger (maybe a multipurpose scalpel like usage)

--redo hypotension effect, preferably slightly animate it

--autoimmune retinopathy when one of eyes die, to prevent it the dead eye needs to be removed

--better eye damage
(damage resistance calculations for eyes, take a look at NT code and make the calculations like that)
Btw @Walter Hartwell White  can easily adapt my code from fall damage for this case
Specifically the concussion resistance function

--fix human update and add into NT update loop instead of running your own

--client side eye effect optimizations

--figure out what to do with eye jar

--enhance bionic eye mechanics

--redo surgeries rn they suck, you shouldn't really need 3 items to perform a surgery, or idk we'll see

--redo trello

--redo affliction icons

--remove one side of the screen getting blinded and instead opt for periphereal vision reduction like wearing a suit

--better enhanced immersion comp

--cosmetic green light effect for NVG eyes

--lens damage for eyes

--replace infrared and night vision eyes with bio-mechanical eyes that can be upgraded like a weaker version of bionic eyes.

--animation for walking blind

--apply the effects of both eyes and a penalty if different types of eyes installed at the same time

--correct lens crafts and usage balance

--enhance the texture for the eye jar (type of eye that shows outside when you put it inside)

--make eye jar placeable AND holdable

--fix item hold positions, SFX (not high priority, but effects overall quality of the mod significantly)

--comp patches for immersive diving and robotrauma

--reduce cataract blur, add gray filter to screen

--Cataracts needs to interact more with the rest of the mod
Why is nt concussion interesting and accepted despite being completely harmless? It causes a lot of symptoms that can be mistaken for other dangerous Afflictions
